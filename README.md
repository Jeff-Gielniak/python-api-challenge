Explanation:  There are two submissions for this assignment - WeatherPy and VacationPy.  The grader will need to use their own Api Key to run either program, as part of the assignment was to create a gitignore folder and make sure to store our API keys in there so they would not be published on a public repository.  Analysis of the data is in the respective .ipynp files when required.
