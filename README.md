I used an hvplots and an API key for Geoapify to create visualizations of hotels determined by specific search parameters.

I also used an API key from Openweathermap.com to get weather data for various cities to analyze and graph.  We then used linregress to evaluate if there was a relationship between various items (latitude, longitude, Wind speed, Humidity, Cloudiness, etc)
